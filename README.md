# M2Latex
From http://freepages.modula2.org/downl.html

M2Latex is a package to help you in translating and pretty printing Modula-2 sources to LaTex. I hope we can make a version for Linux available as the program was developed for SunOS4 and does not compile on Linux boxes at the moment (Any C-people out there willing to help?).
